# Architecture: servo

> Status: Draft — evolves as specs land.

## Skill split

Servo is **scaffolder-first, runtime second**. The four runtime skills all presuppose artifacts the scaffolder dropped into the target.

| Skill | Role | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| `/servo:scaffold-init` | Probe → Q&A → tailored install of `oracle.sh` (+ optional agent-loop/hook/race stubs) | 001 |
| `/servo:quality-gate` | Runtime invocation of scaffolded `oracle.sh`; normalized exit codes | future |
| `/servo:agent-loop` | Headless iteration driver | future |
| `/servo:oracle-hook` | Claude Code hook installer | future |
| `/servo:variant-race` | N-worktree parallel race | future |

## Project vs servo-core split

This is the load-bearing distinction. Servo ships **templates and orchestration**; the project owns **content and policy**.

| Project owns | Servo owns |
|---|---|
| `oracle.sh` content, weights, threshold | Template + signal-detection logic |
| Custom signal functions | `# SEED:` annotation convention |
| Domain-specific lint configs | Normalized exit codes |
| Prompt templates for loops | Loop driver, guardrail defaults |
| Cap + ceiling overrides | Defaults (max-iterations=5, cost-ceiling=$2) |
| Hook event choice, retry phrasing | Hook script template, settings.json mutation + backup |
| Variation strategy, variant count | Worktree management, subagent spawning, scoring |

## Tier model

Mirrors jig's tier-based scaffolding:

- **Tier 0** — `oracle.sh` only. Always installs. Composite score of whatever signals are detected.
- **Tier 1** — Tier 0 + agent-loop driver stub. Offered when the project has signals dense enough to make iteration meaningful (tests + lint + types, or similar).
- **Tier 2** — Tier 1 + hook installer + race driver. **Offered explicitly only.** These are higher-risk surfaces (mutates `settings.json`, races real worktrees) and should never auto-install.

## Signal detection

**Status:** implemented in slice 001-03 (`scaffold.py:detect_signals`).

Probe the target for:

- **Test framework** (pytest / vitest / jest / cargo / go) — prefer jig's `tdd.py detect` via subprocess if `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/jig/skills/tdd-loop/tdd.py` exists, fall back to built-in detectors otherwise. Decision recorded in [ADR-0001](decisions/adr-0001-reuse-jig-test-detector.md).
- **Lint configs** — eslint (`.eslintrc*`, `eslint.config.{js,mjs}`, `package.json#eslintConfig`); ruff (`[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, `.ruff.toml`).
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`.
- **Language** — coarse heuristic from highest-signal file (`pyproject.toml`/`*.py` → python, `package.json`/`*.ts`/`*.js` → javascript, `Cargo.toml` → rust, `go.mod` → go).
- **`oracle.sh` already at target root** → refuse install without `--force` (slice 001-01).
- **`.servo/install.json`** (servo's own manifest, like jig's `scaffold.json`).

Detected components drive which `score_<name>` fragments are spliced into the generated `oracle.sh`. Fragments live under `templates/components/<name>.sh.fragment`. A no-signal target gets a comment-only oracle that exits 2 with `no signals detected — populate # SEED: blocks manually`.

**Audit subcommand:** `scaffold.py detect <target>` prints the full detection payload as JSON (signals + components + per-component weights + which detector ran) without writing anything to disk. Useful for debugging or wizard-mode previews.

## Install manifest

After install, the target gets `.servo/install.json` with:

```json
{
  "servo_version": "0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "<ISO8601>",
  "installed_tier": "tier-0" | "tier-1" | "tier-2",
  "offered_tiers": [...],
  "signals": { "tests": true, "lint": false, "ci": false, "language": "python" },
  "components": ["pytest", "coverage"]
}
```

This is the analog of jig's `scaffold.json` and is what later runtime skills consult to know what was installed.

## Subagents

Servo ships its own `agents/` roster (`runner.md`, `judge.md`, `architect.md`) rather than reusing jig's `implementer.md` / `reviewer.md` / `architect.md`. Reason: jig's subagent prompts assume **supervised** TDD — they narrate, ask clarifying questions, defer ambiguous calls back to the user. Servo's loops are **unattended** — every iteration costs money, no human is watching, and the loop driver needs machine-parseable signals to decide whether to iterate again. The prompts diverge enough that copy-and-rewrite is cleaner than parameterize-and-share. Documented as a future ADR ("Why a fresh subagent roster").

| Servo agent | Jig analog | Why different |
|---|---|---|
| `runner` | `implementer` | Terse, no soliloquy, exit-non-zero on blocker |
| `judge` | `reviewer` | Machine-parseable verdict (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE + score) |
| `architect` | `architect` | Same shape, reworded for unattended-context tradeoffs |

Current state: all three are **placeholders**. Full prompts are authored alongside the specs that need them (spec 003 needs `runner` + `judge`; spec 005 reuses `judge`).

## Runtime artifacts (when later specs land)

Future runtime skills (specs 003–005) will produce these at the *target* project (not in servo's plugin repo):

- `<target>/.servo/runs/<run-id>/` — per-iteration logs from `/servo:agent-loop` (stdout, stderr, oracle score, checkpoint). One subdirectory per loop run.
- `<target>/.servo/hooks/meta-judge.sh` — copied by `/servo:oracle-hook` install; user may customize, uninstall leaves on disk.
- `<target>/.servo/races/<race-id>/` — per-variant scores and metadata from `/servo:variant-race`.

These paths are reserved now (in `.gitignore`) so later specs don't have to renegotiate them.

## Quality-gate JSON contract

Spec 002 shipped `/servo:quality-gate` — the runtime wrapper around `<target>/oracle.sh` that specs 003 / 004 / 005 will all consume. The contract callers can rely on:

**Exit codes** — closed `{0, 1, 2}` set per [ADR-0002](decisions/adr-0002-gate-caller-contract.md). Unexpected oracle exits (signal kill, bash 126/127, app bug returning 99) remap to gate exit 2 with `reason=unexpected_exit code=<N>`.

**Default JSON payload** (`gate.py <target> --json`) — one line, keys always present unless noted:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "exit_code": 0,
  "status": "pass" | "below_threshold" | "env_error",
  "composite": 0.95 | null,
  "threshold": 0.5 | null,
  "missing": [],
  "reason": "..." (optional, only on env_error),
  "code": 99 (optional, only on reason=unexpected_exit),
  "timeout_seconds": 1.0 (optional, only on reason=timeout),
  "raw": {"stdout": "...", "stderr": "..."} (optional, only with --verbose)
}
```

**Closed `reason` taxonomy** (all 11 codes; surfaced when `status="env_error"`):

| `reason` | When |
|---|---|
| `target_missing` | Target path doesn't exist |
| `target_not_directory` | Target exists but isn't a directory |
| `manifest_missing` | `<target>/.servo/install.json` absent |
| `manifest_malformed` | Manifest exists but isn't valid JSON |
| `manifest_invalid_key` | Manifest valid JSON but missing required key (`installed_tier` or `components`) |
| `oracle_missing` | `<target>/oracle.sh` absent (but manifest is present) |
| `oracle_not_executable` | `oracle.sh` exists but lacks the executable bit |
| `invocation_failed` | OS-level error invoking the oracle (rare) |
| `timeout` | Oracle exceeded `--timeout` (or env-var / 300s default) |
| `unexpected_exit` | Oracle exited with a code outside `{0, 1, 2}` |
| `unparseable_oracle_output` | Oracle exited 0 but produced no `composite=X threshold=Y` line |

**Audit JSON** (`gate.py audit <target> --json`) — emits the install manifest verbatim (no `schema_version` field; the manifest has its own schema versioning via `servo_version`). One-line JSON for shape consistency with the invocation `--json`.

**Timeout machinery** — default 300s (5 min), overridable via `--timeout <seconds>` flag or `SERVO_GATE_TIMEOUT` env var. Flag wins on conflict. `--timeout 0` disables the bound. Kill sequence: `SIGTERM` → 5s grace → `SIGKILL`, applied to the oracle's process group (`os.killpg`) so any backgrounded subprocesses are killed too.

**Stateless** — the gate writes nothing to disk. Per-iteration / per-variant persistence is the caller's responsibility (specs 003 / 005).

## Decisions

| ADR | Status | Captures |
|---|---|---|
| [ADR-0001](decisions/adr-0001-reuse-jig-test-detector.md) | Accepted | Reuse jig's `tdd.py detect` via subprocess when co-installed; fall back to built-in detectors otherwise. The first concrete instance of the filesystem-only coupling. |
| [ADR-0002](decisions/adr-0002-gate-caller-contract.md) | Accepted | Quality-gate caller contract: `gate.py` exits only 0/1/2 (unexpected oracle exits remap to 2); `--json` output carries `schema_version` from day one. The contract specs 003/004/005 will consume. |

### Pending (ADR candidates)

Numbers below are *hints* of the next likely allocation order, not reservations — the next accepted ADR claims `0003` regardless of which candidate fires first.

- **ADR-0003 — Why a fresh subagent roster, not reused from jig.** See "Subagents" section above. The risk is duplicated prompt maintenance; the win is prompts that match the operating context. Crystallizes once any of `runner` / `judge` / `architect` actually ships beyond placeholder.
- **ADR-0004 — Why `oracle.sh` stays project-owned plain bash.** Servo scaffolds it; the project owns it forever after. Driving factors: zero servo runtime dependency for the most-invoked artifact, dev can grep + edit without learning a DSL, version-control friendly. Crystallizes if anyone ever proposes a Python or Node oracle alternative.
- **ADR-0005 — Session-state file format on disk.** Spec 003's checkpoint/resume needs a canonical on-disk shape (likely `<target>/.servo/runs/<run-id>/state.json` carrying current-iteration / last-N-actions / hypotheses / cost-burned-so-far / oracle-score-history). This format becomes a cross-plugin soft contract — jig's `slice-land` may want to read it to emit "found a paused servo run — resume?" hints. Same shape as ADR-0001's filesystem-only coupling: no shared imports, just a documented path + JSON schema. Crystallizes when spec 003 reaches READY_FOR_REVIEW.

## Open questions (not yet ADR-worthy)

- **Composite weighting heuristic** — **resolved (slice 001-02):** weighted *average* (`sum(weight*score) / sum(weight)`), with `"name:weight"` registered in a `COMPONENTS` bash array. Equal weights are the scaffold default; tuning is deferred to the user (and surfaced as a `Weights` decision in 001-04's `refinement-todo.md`). Picked weighted average over weighted sum so any threshold in `[0, 1]` is meaningful regardless of how many components are present.
- **`.servo/install.json` checked in vs ignored** — currently `.gitignore`d; revisit when team-shared servo installs become a use case.
- **Scaffold-init interaction with jig-scaffolded projects** — likely fine (no path collisions) but worth an explicit slice-level test in 001-03 or 001-05.
- **Agent-loop driver: shell vs Python.** Leaning shell for Tier 1 (zero deps), Python only if Tier 2 needs the richer state (checkpoint/resume).

## Why no crew skill

Multi-agent crews (hand-off / voting / leader-follower coordination) don't yet generalize enough to scaffold. Servo ships a one-page [post-mortem template](../templates/crew-postmortem.md) for capturing ad-hoc crew experiments, but no `/servo:crew` skill. If post-mortems start showing a consistent pattern, that's a future spec; today it would be premature.

## Internal scoping reference

> Internal-only — kept here to anchor scope decisions during spec
> authoring. Not a public framing of servo; should not leak into
> user-facing docs (README, product-vision, templates).

Each runtime skill traces back to a specific pattern in private learning notes:

| Spec | Skill | Source pattern |
|---|---|---|
| 001 | `/servo:scaffold-init` | (spans the four runtime patterns' setup) |
| 002 | `/servo:quality-gate` | oracle scoring |
| 003 | `/servo:agent-loop` | headless iteration ("Ralph") |
| 004 | `/servo:oracle-hook` | meta-judge hook |
| 005 | `/servo:variant-race` | worktree race |
| n/a | (teams pattern covered) | by jig's `agents/` |
| n/a | (crews pattern skipped) | post-mortem template only |

Decisions land in [docs/decisions/](decisions/) as ADRs once they're hard to reverse.
